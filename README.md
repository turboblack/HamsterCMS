What is all this for?

The script is intended for people who are not knowledgeable in programming 
and who want to quickly create a home page on the Internet

this script is an example of how websites should be made, as I see it, 
how it should be. all these thick frameworks, a bunch of 
additional languages, various hundred-megabyte hipster crafts 
just to deploy an editable home page? - this is not about this script.

This script is also useful for training, the simple code allows for this.
The script is suitable for adherents of old technologies, for ascetic users, 
downgraders, lovers of retro computers and computer equipment,
who want to create a quick, simple, and beautiful home page, or multi-page.

tests showed that the site on this template launched on a 386 computer 
with 16 MHz and 8 RAM under Windows 95 (it will also launch under 3.11 
if Internet Explorer 5 is installed), and specifically on this engine 
it is easily opened by browsers under DOS, and the content is edited 
through the admin panel.

you can also create an HTML5 template and work with it, it’s not difficult, 
about 10 mouse movements, and your site is ready (if you have 
a ready-made template, you replace the HTML code with PHP scripts 
according to the instructions, link above),

in general, for minimalists this is what you need

    Now a little description of this particular template.
as you can see, it is a little similar to the Windows 95 interface, 
made in HTML4 without frameworks and add-ons that could work 
with very old browsers from the 90s 
(will work in IE5 since it has support for UTF8).

For the script to work, you only need free hosting with support 
for PHP 7.4 (although it will work on 5).
copy the files as is to the hosting, open, check - it works.
so that you have 5 pages (for which it is designed), open index.php 
and edit index.php?p=index.txt these links, replacing their names 
with your own, for example index.php?p=about.txt
after which you go to the admin panel admin.php, enter your 
login and password (login password), select open the file at the top, edit, save.
Don’t forget to also change your login and password by 
editing the admin.php file, the name of which can also be changed, 
this will not affect performance.

articles that we create in the admin panel and save below in the bottom menu by writing ./article.txt and click save.
This creates a page that is not visible in the navigation bar, but will be visible separately on the page where we place the link
index.php?p=article.txt

I deliberately did not write copyrights in the template, because you are erasing them )))

in addition, with copyrights the template will not look authentic

Enjoy your use.

thank you for your attention
